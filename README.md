## InterActive Fiction Adventure made with Python

### Things You Might Want To Know

#### About the Story
Based on the classic 1969 scifi novel, *The Left Hand of Darkness* written by the "Godmother of Science Fiction," Ursula K Le Guin, this Interactive Fiction Adventure imagines that you are an ambassador from a confederation of planets on a mission to persuade the inhabitants of the planet you have landed upon to join said confederation.  But, because of a lack of understanding causes the ruler of the planet to distrust you and imprison you.  This adventure begins with **YOU, the hero** (who needs saving) locked in the heart of the prison.  You have been drugged to keep you passive, and find that your constitution cannot stand much more as your physiology greatly differs from the natives' and one more dosage could put you into an unwaking coma.  Luckily, you receive word from the exiled Prime Minister, who is the only one on your side that he has devised a plan to save you and return you to your ship so you can leave the planet.  But, he cannot enter the prison.  He has bribed a sentry to leave you clues to a secret passageway out (convenient! but, not really). You must solve the puzzles while avoiding the guards to make your way out of imprisonment! **[Cue suspenseful music!]**

#### Levels
(If you want to be hardcore, you can skip this section. Next comes "Game Details")

**Level 1**
You awake and see a cryptic message left for you. You must decifer it to find the key that will allow you to escape your cell.  Once out, you must find your way out of the maze of the cell block you are relegated to without bumping into any sentries.  Take too long to decifer the message and be in danger of recieving your next scheduled drug dosage. Find the key too late, and risk a guard seeing you try to escape your cell.

**Level 2**
Navagate other cell blocks while convincing (and other times threatening) other inmates to help you (or keep quiet).  Some prisoners might too passive to respond, while others have tidbits that will help you find your way--a few prisoners have kept enough wits about them to hide a useful tool or two.

**Level 3**
Something will happen...
